# MSAF Structure Analysis Dependencies
# Install in a SEPARATE venv or alongside existing deps carefully.
#
# MSAF is an older library with potential version conflicts.
# The fallback (librosa_novelty) works WITHOUT msaf — only needs librosa + scipy.
#
# Option 1: Full MSAF (best results, but may conflict with newer libs)
#   pip install msaf
#   Note: msaf pins older numpy/scipy/sklearn versions.
#   If conflicts arise, use Option 2 instead.
#
# Option 2: Librosa-only fallback (no msaf needed, already in your venv)
#   librosa>=0.10.0
#   scipy>=1.10.0
#   matplotlib>=3.7.0
#   numpy>=1.23.0
#
# The script auto-detects whether msaf is installed and falls back gracefully.

# Core (already installed in your venv)
librosa>=0.10.0
scipy>=1.10.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0
numpy>=1.23.0

# Optional — install only if you want full MSAF algorithms (CNMF, Foote)
# msaf>=0.1.8
